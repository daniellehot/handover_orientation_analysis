# Handover orientation analysis
This GitHub repository holds the code for and findings of the analysis performed on the human-to-human handover dataset assembled for our ROB10 project.

Folder *data* contains various data collected from the performed analyses. Folder *observations* contains human-to-human handover observations group on object class categories.
Folders *mean_handover_orientations* and *visual_clustering* contains figures, that can be found in our project.

## Code
**NOTE - ALL THE CODE IS USING FULL PATHS RATHER THAN AN PROJECT PATHS. PLEASE, CHANGE THESE ACCORDINGLY BEFORE YOU RUN ANY CODE. ALL THE REQUIRED DATA IS PROVIDED IN THIS REPOSITORY.**

**find_mean_handover_orientations.py** finds mean handover orientations, one per each object class.\
**visual_analysis.py** provides visualizations for the visual clustering of the observations.\
**visualisations.py** visualizes the computed mean handover orientations.\
**visualise_mean_orientations_per_groups.py** visualizes the computed mean handover orientations per clusters identified by **visual_analysis.py**.
